A definitive solution is yet to be found due to the intermittent and vague nature of the error. However, several strategies can be implemented to improve the situation:

1. **Detailed Logging:** Enhance the logging during the `expo prebuild` process to capture more information.  This can involve custom scripts or modifying the underlying build process to emit more detailed error reports. Examine the build logs carefully for any clues.
2. **Isolation:** Create a minimal reproducible example (MRE) by stripping down the project to its bare essentials. This can help determine if the issue stems from a specific dependency or code segment.   Isolate your code and test step by step to identify if the problem is with a particular library or feature.
3. **Environment Consistency:** Ensure a consistent development environment across machines to rule out environmental factors. This includes using consistent versions of Node.js, npm or yarn, Xcode (for iOS) or Android Studio (for Android), and other tools.
4. **Community Support:** Report the issue on the Expo forums or GitHub issue tracker, including detailed error messages and logs, and the project's relevant configuration files. Sharing information will help identify patterns or known solutions. 
5. **Temporary Workarounds:**  If a particular build consistently fails, consider creating a separate development branch that works around the issue (e.g., temporarily removing a problematic dependency) as a temporary fix. You can try downgrading versions of Expo dependencies as well.
