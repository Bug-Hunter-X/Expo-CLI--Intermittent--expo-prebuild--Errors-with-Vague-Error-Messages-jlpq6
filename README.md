# Expo CLI: Intermittent `expo prebuild` Errors

This repository demonstrates an issue with the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command, which intermittently throws vague error messages during the build process.  The problem is characterized by unpredictable failures, even after attempting standard troubleshooting techniques.

## Reproducing the Issue

The exact steps to reproduce the issue are difficult to pinpoint due to its intermittent nature. However, the problem often appears during development and release builds.

## Potential Causes

Possible root causes may include:

* Issues with native module integration.
* Problems with the underlying build system (e.g., Xcode, Android Studio).
* Transient network problems interfering with dependency resolution.
* Bugs within Expo CLI itself.

## Solutions Attempted

The following actions have been taken without resolving the problem:

* Clearing the Expo cache.
* Reinstalling dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
* Creating a new Expo project.
* Checking network connectivity.
* Updating Expo CLI and related dependencies.

## Further Investigation

Further investigation is required to pinpoint the exact cause of these intermittent errors and find a consistent solution.  This repository serves as a starting point for debugging and community collaboration to address this issue.
